The placement of the /ʊ/ is a bit controversial. The current location is the one determined by
Praat from the reference recording, which is also approximately the same vowel as in the 
American "foot" pronunciation, which is usually transcribed as ʊ (the value given by Wells to the
FOOT lexical set). However, the RP pronunciation is audibly different and seems to be producible
with a lower F1 score of around 300. This is about where Catford 1988 places it. This also is the
only explanation for oʊ diphthongs, which qualitatively require a decrease in F1, and only makes
sense if ʊ has the lower F1 value.

Praat for close vowels is pretty poor
